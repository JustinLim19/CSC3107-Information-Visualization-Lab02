## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
if (!requireNamespace("dplyr", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!requireNamespace("tidyr", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("tidyr")
if (!requireNamespace("gt", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("gt")
if (!requireNamespace("styler", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("styler")
if (!requireNamespace("lintr", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("lintr")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(gt)
library(styler)
library(lintr)
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
# Load raw data
raw_data <- read.csv("asean_meat_production.csv")

# Inspect the first few rows of the data to ensure column names are correct
head(raw_data)

# Inspect unique values in the 'meat' column
unique(raw_data$meat)
```

```{r}
# Standardize meat type names if necessary
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(meat = case_when(
    meat == "Beef and Buffalo Meat" ~ "Beef and Buffalo Meat",
    meat == "Pig meat" ~ "Pig Meat", # Standardizing to "Pig Meat"
    meat == "Mutton and Goat Meat" ~ "Mutton and Goat Meat",
    meat == "Poultry meat" ~ "Poultry Meat", # Standardizing to "Poultry Meat"
    TRUE ~ meat # Keep other values unchanged
  ))
```

```{r}
# Data cleaning and manipulation
data_wide <- raw_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = meat, values_from = kt) %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  mutate(
    Total_meat_production = rowSums(
      across(
        c(`Beef and Buffalo Meat`, `Pig Meat`, `Mutton and Goat Meat`, `Poultry Meat`),
        ~ replace_na(.x, 0)
      )
    )
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# Filter the data for the year 2021
data_2021 <- data_wide %>%
  filter(year == 2021)

# Create the table
table_gt <- data_2021 %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Table 10.14. Livestock and Poultry Meat Production in ASEAN, 2018-2021",
    subtitle = "(in thousand metric tons)"
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Livestock production",
    columns = c(`Beef and Buffalo Meat`, `Pig Meat`, `Mutton and Goat Meat`)
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Poultry production",
    columns = c(`Poultry Meat`)
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    `Beef and Buffalo Meat` = "Beef and Buffalo Meat",
    `Pig Meat` = "Pig Meat",
    `Mutton and Goat Meat` = "Mutton and Goat Meat",
    `Poultry Meat` = "Poultry Meat",
    Total_meat_production = "Total meat production"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(
    columns = c(`Beef and Buffalo Meat`, `Pig Meat`, `Mutton and Goat Meat`, `Poultry Meat`, Total_meat_production),
    decimals = 1
  ) %>%
  cols_align(
    align = "center",
    columns = everything()
  )

# Print the table
table_gt
```

```{r}
# Apply styling to your R script
style_file("Team Lab Assignment 2- Presenting ASEAN Meat Production as a Table.qmd")

# Lint your script to find potential issues
lint("Team Lab Assignment 2- Presenting ASEAN Meat Production as a Table.qmd")
```
The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
